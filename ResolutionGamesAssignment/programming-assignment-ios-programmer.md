## Preparations

The very first thing you should do is read through these instructions.
After that, send an e-mail to the e-mail address mentioned in the invite, with your suggested deadline for submission.

This means you choose your own deadline. There is no need to ask us if the deadline is OK.
After that, start working on the task and submit it no later than the deadline.

## Instructions

The purpose of this task is so we can better assess your skills in a real life coding situation. The task is to build an augmented reality iOS-app with the following flow:

1. The user will be guided to scan their room until a horizontal plane is detected. The built-in ARCoachingOverlay is okay to use.
2. Two cubes will be placed on a horizontal plane in front of the phone, one red and one blue.
3. Any time the user taps the red cube, it will jump towards the blue cube.
4. Any time the user taps the blue cube, it will jump away from the red cube.

The app must be built using Swift and RealityKit. Either SwiftUI or UIKit is fine as a UI framework. We will look at how the app is structured as well as the readability and maintainability of the code. It should be possible to easily add new behaviors and objects. Feel free to use the included 3D-models to complete the task.

## Submission

When finished, please compress the project directory to a zip-file and send it to us.
